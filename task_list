 * reestablish json_node containing a union of data types dstring, hashmap, array
 * hashmap inside json_node being dstring vs json_node*
 * rewrite serializer for the new json_node
 * re-write the parser as a top-down recursive descent parser
   * define grammar in the comments
   * write simple lexer
   * write recursive descent parser
   * json_node struct and the api of parser and serializer remains the same
